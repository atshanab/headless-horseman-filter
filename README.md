# Headless Horseman Filter (MediaPipe)
Turns you into the **headless horseman**: your live head is removed from your body, and a cutout of your head is placed into the rider's hand.

## How to Use
1. Allow the camera and tap **Start**.
2. Face the camera and tap **ðŸŽ­ Capture Head** once your face is centered.
3. Adjust **Head Scale / X / Y** so the severed head sits perfectly in the hand.
4. Toggle **Hide Live Head** to remove your on-body head (headless effect).
5. Tap **ðŸ“¸ Take Photo** to save/share.

## Art Direction
- Replace `assets/horseman.png` with your own artwork (PNG with **transparent hand hole** where the head should appear).
- If your artâ€™s hand position differs, use the **Head X/Y/Scale** sliders to place the head.
- For flawless results, prepare the background PNG at the same aspect you expect on phone (portrait 1080Ã—1920 works well).

## Hosting
Upload to a new GitHub repo (root), enable **GitHub Pages**, and open the Pages URL (HTTPS).
